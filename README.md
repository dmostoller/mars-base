# Mars Base

A game where the user is a settler on a Mars base - they must perform tasks to generate resources to keep the stationâ€™s systems online.

User will be able to:

See list of available tasks
Perform tasks that generate resources 
resources get spent as player attempts tasks
Player loses if they run out of resources
Random events happen that use resources 
(alien attack, micrometeorite stike, solar flare)



Stretch Goals:

Tasks have difficulty level and with randomized failures based on difficulty 
Tasks take place in different rooms of the base and the player has to move to various rooms to perform the tasks. 
multiple settlers - or commanding a team like in the mechanic game



TODO:

make it so that a user can create new tasks (input a name, resource and description -- recieve hefty but random amount of resource as reward)

add random events that add resources
